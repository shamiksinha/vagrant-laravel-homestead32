<b class="req">Udbodhan Patrika</b> - A century and beyond marching onwards tirelessly:
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ramakrishna Math & Mission is undoubtedly the brightest of stars in the firmament of India as a Socio-Religious organization par excellence. It was the great Indian spiritual leader Sri Ramakrishna and later his famed disciple Swami Vivekananda that brought a sea change in the horizon of Bengal. It was the singular vision of RKM to ensure the brightness of their knowledge shine upon the rest of the country to become a driving force that sets Hinduism apart. It was the teachings of the Guru Sri Ramakrishna and the message spread by Sri Vivekananda that percolated the fragrance of Indian thought across the globe.
<br />
One of the efforts of Swami Vivekananda was the "Udbodhan Patrika" that became a catalyst to spread a new vision of India. Till the present times it is this Patrika that has sparkled with the brilliance of a thousand stars to spread a unique vision of the times in Bengal. The word Udbodhan in Bengali means "Opening" and this fabled magazine has been aptly named so. It has acted as the instrument that has opened the heart and minds of not just the people of Bengal but people all over the world. Not just this but the entire publishing effort initiated then has come a long way in propagating myriad thoughts to people all over.
<br />
