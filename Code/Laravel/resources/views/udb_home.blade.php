<b class="req">Udbodhan Patrika</b> - A century and beyond marching onwards tirelessly:
<br />
<br />
<br />

The Ramakrishna Math & Mission is undoubtedly the brightest of stars in the firmament of India as a Socio-Religious organization par excellence. It was the great Indian spiritual leader Sri Ramakrishna and later his famed disciple Swami Vivekananda that brought a sea change in the horizon of Bengal. It was the singular vision of RKM to ensure the brightness of their knowledge shine upon the rest of the country to become a driving force that sets Hinduism apart. It was the teachings of  Sri Ramakrishna and the message spread by Swami Vivekananda that pervaded the fragrance of Indian spiritual thought across the globe.
<br />
One of the efforts of Swami Vivekananda was the   “Udbodhan Patrika” that became a catalyst to spread a new vision of India. Till the present time it is this Patrika that has sparkled with the brilliance of  thousand stars to spread a unique vision of the times in Bengal. The word Udbodhan in Bengali means “Opening” and this fabled magazine has been aptly named so. It has acted as the instrument that has opened the heart and minds of not just the people of Bengal but people all over the world. Not just this but the entire publishing effort initiated then has come a long way in propagating myriad thoughts to people all over.
<br />  
Now, about the digitisation process, it is Adamaris Consultancy Services and their group of dedicated members that has brought this project alive. Imagine spending days of hardwork converting those brittle hundred year old magazine pages and rendering them into digital copy. If you are someone who values what history has bequeathed to us through these pages of wisdom, then this is the treasure trove you’ve been looking for. There is such tremendous antique value in all of these old issues that it brings alive the visions of a glorious past. If you want to know what India and Bengal were like, what the society was like, what thoughts were prevalent then, this is indeed the ultimate source of reference. Each edition has gems contributed by the most eminent authors and thinkers of yesteryears. The entire project is an amazing collection of thoughts from a past era that has been brought alive for you again.
